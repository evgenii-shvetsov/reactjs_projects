**Getting Started with Adding a course app**

In the project directory, you can run:

**npm install**

Install all dependencies from package.json file

**npm start**

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

**npm run build**

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
